# ProjectOne
Welcome to ProjectOne! An Ethereum Dapp that allows the donors to help out the underserved communities through fundraising projects.  It is written in Django, Solidity, Web3.js and Web3.py.

The smart contract is built to accomplish the following functionalities:
1) Allow users with 'Admin' role to create new fundraising projects and funding distribution requests.
2) Allow users with 'Donor' role to donate to the funding projects and vote to the spending requests. 
3) Allow users with 'Admin' role to complete the spending requests if donors have reached consensus.

### Setting up the environment in your localhost
1) Downloaded the source code from Github.

2) Make sure you have Python installed in your machine.  

3) Change directory to project folder ProjectOne and install all the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4) Update fundraising/settings.py and set paramters of web3.py to work with your blockchain provider. If you are working with Ganache be sure to change the following parameters with the ones in your Ganache workspace:

```
provider = "***RPC_server***"
chain_Id = "***network_id***"
```

Change the value of my_address and private_key to set your admin account (I used the first one in my Ganache workspace), from this account will be sent all the transactions for the creation of a new project:

```
my_address = "***admin_address***"
private_key = "***admin_private_key***"
```
5) Start Django local development server:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate 
```

Create a superuser as your admin account.

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

```
python manage.py runserver
```

6) Start ProjectOne Dapp from a browser session that has MetaMask installed:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Test Drive ProjectOne from Heroku
ProjectOne has been deployed to Heroku from the link provided below.  The Dapp is configured to interact with the smart contract deployed in Ropsten Network.

You can use the following test account/password or create your own account for a test drive.

```
admin/123
donor1/123
donor2/123
donor3/123
```
